I"ö<p>I am a Research Associate and a member of EPSRC-supported Glasgow Computational Engineering Centre (<a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/gcec/">GCEC</a>). Currently, I am working as PDRA in an <a href="https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/T008415/1">EPSRC project</a> on predictive modelling of Incremental Cold Flow Forming (ICFF).</p>

<p>My PhD project, supported by <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/ourresearchenvironment/prs/kelvinsmith/previouslyawardedkelvinsmithphdscholarships/201415projects/#d.en.359938,investigationoftheboneadaptationandfractureinthethirdmetacarpal(mciii)boneofthoroughbredracehorses-karollewandowski(lkasphdcandidate)">Lord Kelvin and Adam Smith Scholarship</a>, was focused on computational methods to predict and prevent musculoskeletal injury and fatality in the Thoroughbred racehorse.</p>

<p>My main interests are: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">computational mechanics</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">additive manufacturing</code> technology, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">virtual and augmented reality</code> scientific visualisation and sustainable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">research code development</code> (mostly <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C++</code>).</p>

<p>I am a senior developer of finite element library at the <a href="http://mofem.eng.gla.ac.uk/">MoFEM</a> team.</p>

<!-- My research interests are on the development of novel approaches for numerical modelling in `computational mechanics` with a particular focus on biomechanics, fracture mechanics, modelling of complex manufacturing processes and `High Performance Computing`. 

Aside from research, I am also interested in `additive manufacturing` technology, `virtual and augmented reality` scientific visualisation and sustainable `research code development` (mostly `C++`). -->

<!-- During my PhD, I also supported a project on modelling fracture in irradiated graphite bricks in Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactors in collaboration with industrial partners (EDF Energy and Jacobs). This work led to the submission of an `impact case to REF2021`. -->
