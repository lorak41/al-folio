I"a<p>The numerical implementation of the proposed numerical scheme is carried out using the open-source library MoFEM. The library integrates and utilizes other open-source libraries such as MOAB, a mesh-oriented database, and PETSc. The MOAB library is used to store and manage mesh related data, while PETSc is used for parallel operations involving linear algebra.</p>
