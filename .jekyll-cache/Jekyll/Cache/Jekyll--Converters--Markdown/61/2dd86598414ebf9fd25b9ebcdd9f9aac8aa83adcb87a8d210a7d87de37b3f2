I"ß<p><a href="http://mofem.eng.gla.ac.uk/mofem/">MoFEM</a> (Mesh-oriented Finite Element Method) is a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C++</code> library for managing complexities related to the finite element method (FEM). FEM is a widely used numerical approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) arising in various physical problems. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MoFEM</code> is developed to provide a finite element library incorporating modern approximation approaches and data structures for engineers, students and academics.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MoFEM</code> is an advanced open-source Finite Element (FE) libraries. The catalyst for the creation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MoFEM</code> was the need for a flexible and numerically accurate modelling environment for multi-physics problems posed by our partners, including industry (EDF Energy, Jacobs, Advanced Forming Research Centre, etc).</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MoFEM</code> delivers a software development platform that enhances scientific innovation by providing a flexible and adaptable modelling framework, using novel disruptive approaches to long-standing problems in continuum mechanics and tackling conflicting requirements of accuracy and computational efficiency. This is achieved in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MoFEM</code> by developing and adopting state-of-the-art FE technologies, for example, H1-, H(curl)-, H(div)- and L2-conforming finite elements equipped with hierarchical, heterogeneous, and anisotropic approximation bases; error-driven hp-adaptivity; mesh topology evolution. In addition, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MoFEM</code>â€™s HPC capabilities are supported by its unique data structures capable of handling generic multi-field, multi-physics and multi-scale problems.</p>

<p>Therefore, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MoFEM</code> provides users with an effective tool for solving Partial Differential Equations arising in various fields of Engineering and Applied Physics: solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, soft matter physics, heat transfer, electromagnetism etc. Furthermore, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MoFEM</code> features an extendable modular design: while its open-source core library is developed to manage the complexities of FEM, additional user modules are devoted to particular applications. Such a toolkit-like structure allows for independent development of modules with different repositories, owners and licences.</p>

<p>An extensive list of features can be found under <a href="http://mofem.eng.gla.ac.uk/mofem/html/motivation.html">this link </a>.</p>

<p>Installation, functionality and documentation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MoFEM</code> were independently verified by five open reviewers to satisfy the standards of the <a href="https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01441">Journal of Open Source Software</a>.</p>
