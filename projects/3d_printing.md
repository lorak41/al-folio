### Leveraging CT-Scan Data for 3D-Printed Anatomical Models

My expertise in `segmenting` and `postprocessing CT-scan data` has been effectively utilized in creating 3D-printed anatomical models. This endeavor includes:

- **3D Printing of Anatomical Models:** Using advanced data processing skills to transform CT-scan data into accurate 3D-printed models. A notable example is the model of a `horse fetlock joint`.

- **Enhancing Data Processing Skills:** This process allowed me to refine and practice my data processing abilities, crucial in handling complex anatomical structures.

- **Educational and Visualization Tool:** The 3D-printed models serve as valuable educational resources and visualization tools, aiding in the understanding of intricate anatomical details.

This application of my technical skills in a practical, educational context demonstrates the versatility and real-world impact of my work in data processing and 3D modeling.
