The numerical implementation of the proposed numerical scheme is carried out using the open-source library MoFEM. The library integrates and utilizes other open-source libraries such as MOAB, a mesh-oriented database, and PETSc. The MOAB library is used to store and manage mesh related data, while PETSc is used for parallel operations involving linear algebra.


Here it would be nice to insert the links about cache mises and all
