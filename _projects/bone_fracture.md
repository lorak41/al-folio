In this PhD project, a computational tool assessing `fracture risk` in horse racing, specifically targeting `metacarpal bone fractures`, has been developed {% cite lewandowski2020thesis lewandowski2021computational lewandowski2020numerical karol2019conf %}.

**Development of Computational Tools:** Implementation of `finite element models`, using state-of-the-art imaging (`CT scans`) and `segmentation algorithms`, enables accurate simulation of `bone remodeling` under specific loads. This aids in assessing the `fracture resistance` of equine metacarpal bones, a critical aspect in preventing racing injuries.

**Accurate Bone Representation:** Utilizing advanced `numerical analysis techniques`, including `Moving Weighted Least Squares approximation` and `L2-projection`, the research accurately captures the complex `geometry` and `material properties` of bones. This precise representation is fundamental in assessing `fracture risks` and understanding bone behavior under stress.

**Simulation of Bone Adaptation:** The research introduces a novel `finite element method` to simulate `adaptive bone changes`, rooted in the `thermodynamics of open systems`. This approach has shown promising potential in accurately simulating long-term bone responses to various training conditions, significantly impacting treatment strategies for `bone implants`.

**Fracture Risk Assessment:** A critical part of the research involved comparing two approaches for `crack propagation analysis`: `smeared phase-field` and `discrete configurational mechanics`. This comparison revealed the capabilities and limitations of each method in predicting `crack paths` in heterogeneous bodies, highlighting the phase-fieldâ€™s relative inefficiency due to finer `mesh requirements`.

**Validation and Implications:** Through rigorous `numerical simulations`, including studies on equine metacarpal bones, the research validated the effectiveness of the developed framework. It demonstrated how `bone adaptation history` and `density distribution` critically influence `fracture resistance` and `crack paths`. These insights provide a novel framework for simulating changes in bone structure in response to exercise and quantifying `fracture likelihood`.
