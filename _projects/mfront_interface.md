## Advanced Material Modeling with MFront Integration in MoFEM


MoFEM now boasts an integration with <a href='https://thelfer.github.io/mgis/web/index.html'>MFront</a> , a versatile code generator that uses C++ and `domain-specific languages` to facilitate the implementation of novel material properties and mechanical behaviors.

The integration allows MoFEM users to rapidly implement and integrate a comprehensive library of complex material behaviors from the MFront library. This includes a wide array of models covering:

- `Concrete`
- `Damage`
- `Plasticity`
- `Crystal plasticity`
- `Heat Transfer`
- `Wood`
- `Hyperelastic materials`
- and more...

The collaboration with MFront significantly broadens MoFEM's scope in computational mechanics, enabling users to tackle a more diverse range of material modeling challenges. Moreover, the user can specify a different material law on every block of the mesh.
