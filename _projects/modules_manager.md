## MoFEM Modules Manager Initiative

The `MoFEM Modules Manager` represents a strategic initiative aimed at combining the diverse functionalities of individual MoFEM modules into a unified and potent simulation engine. This innovative approach facilitates the integration of different simulation aspects, significantly enhancing MoFEM's capability for multiphysics analysis.

One of the prime instance of its application is in the simulation of cable cleats conducted for `ContinuumBlue`. This complex simulation required a multidisciplinary method that brought together `hyperelastic materials`, `dynamics`, `plasticity`, `contact mechanics`, and `electromechanical interactions`. The Modules Manager was pivotal in combining these elements into an efficient and synchronized simulation workflow.
