### Collaboration in Orthopedic Innovation

Our project represented a significant advancement in `orthopedic treatment`, merging the fields of `bone mechanics` and `orthopedic surgery`. This collaboration aimed to improve methods for treating `bone defects`, particularly in the context of `limb reconstruction`. Highlights of this initiative included:

- **Interdisciplinary Collaboration:** A joint effort that bridged advanced research in `bone mechanics` with practical `orthopedic applications`.
  
- **Focus on Bone Remodeling and Ilizarov Fixators:** Enhancing existing `bone remodeling simulations` to address bone defects and the mechanics of `Ilizarov fixator systems`.

- **Presented at BLRS 2021:** The project's findings were featured at the prestigious `British Limb Reconstruction Society (BLRS) 2021 Annual Scientific Meeting`.

### Research on Tibial Defects and Fine Wire Fixators

Our study, titled "`Finite Element Modelling of Tibial Defects Managed with a Fine Wire Fixator`," introduced new insights into the treatment of `tibial defects`. Key aspects of this research included:

- **Application of Finite Element Analysis (FEA):** Developing a model to understand the `mechanical response` in `tibial defects`, overcoming limitations of traditional clinical methods.

- **Methodological Innovation:** Using `CT imaging` for precise modeling of `tibial defects` and constructing a detailed simulation of an `Ilizarov fixator` under various conditions.

- **Insightful Findings:** The research revealed key insights about the impact of `defect size` on `strain` and the minimal influence of `bone material properties` on defect mechanics.

- **Conclusion and Impact:** We aimed to further refine this model for broader applications in `limb reconstruction`, demonstrating the potential of this method in enhancing `orthopedic treatment strategies`.
