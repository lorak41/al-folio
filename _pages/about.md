I am a Research Associate and a member of EPSRC-supported Glasgow Computational Engineering Centre ([GCEC](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/gcec/)). Currently, I am working as PDRA in an [EPSRC project](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/T008415/1) on predictive modelling of Incremental Cold Flow Forming (ICFF).

My PhD project, supported by [Lord Kelvin and Adam Smith Scholarship](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/ourresearchenvironment/prs/kelvinsmith/previouslyawardedkelvinsmithphdscholarships/201415projects/#d.en.359938,investigationoftheboneadaptationandfractureinthethirdmetacarpal(mciii)boneofthoroughbredracehorses-karollewandowski(lkasphdcandidate)), was focused on computational methods to predict and prevent musculoskeletal injury and fatality in the Thoroughbred racehorse. 

My main interests are: `computational mechanics`, `additive manufacturing` technology, `virtual and augmented reality` scientific visualisation and sustainable `research code development` (mostly `C++`). 

I am a senior developer of finite element library at the [MoFEM](http://mofem.eng.gla.ac.uk/) team.


<!-- My research interests are on the development of novel approaches for numerical modelling in `computational mechanics` with a particular focus on biomechanics, fracture mechanics, modelling of complex manufacturing processes and `High Performance Computing`. 

Aside from research, I am also interested in `additive manufacturing` technology, `virtual and augmented reality` scientific visualisation and sustainable `research code development` (mostly `C++`). -->


<!-- During my PhD, I also supported a project on modelling fracture in irradiated graphite bricks in Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactors in collaboration with industrial partners (EDF Energy and Jacobs). This work led to the submission of an `impact case to REF2021`. -->
