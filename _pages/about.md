I am a Research Associate and a member of EPSRC-supported Glasgow Computational Engineering Centre ([GCEC](https://www.gla.ac.uk/research/az/gcec/)). Currently, I am working as PDRA in an [EPSRC project](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/T008415/1) on predictive modelling of Incremental Cold Flow Forming (ICFF), where I continue software development of the [MoFEM](http://mofem.eng.gla.ac.uk/) library. \
My PhD project, supported by `Lord Kelvin and Adam Smith Scholarship`, was focused on computational methods to predict and prevent musculoskeletal injury and fatality in the Thoroughbred racehorse. 
<!-- During my PhD, I also supported a project on modelling fracture in irradiated graphite bricks in Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactors in collaboration with industrial partners (EDF Energy and Jacobs). This work led to the submission of an `impact case to REF2021`. -->

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
